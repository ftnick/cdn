## WEB-BASED / API VALIDATION
Test https://discord.com/invite/mcrc - confirm HTTP 200 / redirect response

Test https://discord.com/invite/discord-developers - confirm HTTP 200 / redirect response
Test https://discord.gg/discord-developers - confirm HTTP 200 / redirect response
Test Discord status page: https://status.discord.com - check for outages or API incidents

## DEVICE, TIME, DNS, AND CACHE
Ensure system time, date, and timezone are correct (critical for TLS verification)
Change DNS or use default/public DNS (Google: 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4; Cloudflare: 1.1.1.1)
Check router/firewall rules: ensure TCP 443 and UDP 50000–60000 are allowed
Flush DNS cache
  Windows: ipconfig /flushdns
  macOS: sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
  Linux: sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
Verify hosts file: ensure discord.com, discord.gg, and related domains are not blocked
Remove Discord app cache (%appdata%\discord\Cache) and restart Discord
Clear browser cache and cookies if using web client
Restart device after changes

## APPLICATION / ACCOUNT VERIFICATION
Test both browser and desktop app access
Confirm account is not restricted or disabled
Re-login to Discord
Try creating a new temporary account to rule out account-specific issues
Update Discord to the latest version
Reinstall Discord if persistent issues occur

## NETWORK / ISP TROUBLESHOOTING
Test alternate network (e.g., mobile hotspot) to rule out local network blocks
Disable VPN or proxy (may trigger Discord access restrictions)
Confirm required TCP/UDP ports are open using network diagnostics
Check for ISP-level blocks or throttling
Use traceroute/ping to discord.com and discord.gg to detect packet loss or routing issues
Reset network settings if necessary (Windows: netsh winsock reset; macOS: network preferences reset)

## FIREWALL / ANTIVIRUS
Temporarily disable firewall/antivirus to test if Discord is blocked
Add Discord to firewall/antivirus exceptions
Check router-level firewall for blocked ports or IPs

## SYSTEM / OS
Check for any parental controls, security policies, or enterprise restrictions
Verify TLS/SSL libraries are up-to-date
Check for any VPN or proxy software running in the background

## LOGGING / DIAGNOSTICS
Check Discord logs (%appdata%\discord\logs) for errors
Browser developer tools (F12 > Network tab) to inspect web connection errors
Collect ping/traceroute results to provide to support if needed
Use Discord debug mode for advanced troubleshooting (Settings > Appearance > Advanced > Enable Developer Mode / Debug logs)
